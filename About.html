        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm born and raised in Las Vegas, so it's no surprise I gravitate to more creative outlets, hence my desire to become an actor in the first place! 
            I was an I.T professional of over 20 years, with an Associate's and Bachelor's Degree. I enjoy fitness through kickboxing, Muay Thai, and Jiu Jitsu.
            I've also been a huge gamer my entire life, so when I'm not fixing things, kicking things, or speaking into a mic, I'm getting my butt kicked and yelling at my tv cause the final boss mechanics are bullsh*t obviously.
